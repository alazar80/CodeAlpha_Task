# CodeAlpha - Basic Network Sniffer 🔍📡

## 📌 Cyber Security Internship Task 1

This project is a **Python-based network sniffer** built using the `scapy` library.  
It captures and analyzes live packets on your network interface, extracting protocol, IP, and port-level details.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Capture live network traffic packets.
- Analyze and print:
  - Source & Destination IPs
  - Protocol used (TCP/UDP)
  - Source & Destination ports
- Log packets to a file (`captured_packets.txt`)

---

## 💻 Tech Stack

- Python
- `scapy` (for packet sniffing and protocol inspection)
- 'npcap'
